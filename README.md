# ulti.draft

This is a web application made for drafting ultimate frisbee players for recreational leagues. The commissioner has the ability to set up the draft and once it's live, the captains can join and draft their players. After the draft is complete, users can visit the league page and see all of the teams with their respective players.

## Motivation

I absolutely love the sport of ultimate frisbee. I have been playing for 8 years and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. Year round, there are recreational leagues that start off with a draft. I have participated in multiple league drafts as a captain and they are always done using either whiteboards or an excel sheet. While fun, they can get kind of hectic and drag on longer than they should. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to solve a problem for a community I deeply care about.
